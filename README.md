# Landslide Prediction and Early Warning System using AI and IoT

This repository contains an AI-powered landslide prediction model built using the **Resnet50** and **DeeepLabV3** architecture for high-resolution image segmentation.
The model is trained on satellite imagery datasets with landslide masks to detect and segment landslide-prone areas.  
It can be integrated into hazard mapping tools and early warning systems for disaster risk management.

## 🌍 Project Overview

Landslides pose serious threats to communities, infrastructure, and the environment.  
This project leverages **deep learning** to detect potential landslides from geospatial imagery.  
By using **Resnet50**, a powerful vision transformer-based architecture, the model delivers accurate segmentation results even on complex terrain.
